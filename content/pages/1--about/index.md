  The game of cricket has a wide wealth of complex statistical data associated with the game. Analysts and fans throughout history have crunched the numbers, trying to make meaning out of this vast pool of data. The aim of this project is to attempt the same using data mining techniques to hopefully unearth key underlying data patterns that can be used to accurately model in-game performances.
